# Culvers Scraper

This program currently scrapes one culver's locations website to return the flavors of the day for the month. The specific location (loc) can be found by going to your local 
Culvers website and hovering your mouse over the add to calendar for a flavor. In the bottom left of your screen, a preview of the url will appear. The loc is given before the date (ex: https://www.culvers.com/fotd-add-to-calendar/1/2022-02-08 has a store location of 1)
